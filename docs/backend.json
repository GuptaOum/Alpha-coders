    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support the AI-powered disease outbreak detection and warning system (\"Sentinel\"). User data and symptom reports are stored in separate collections to maintain a clear separation of concerns and facilitate efficient querying. The structure prioritizes authorization independence by storing ownership within the `SymptomReport` document, eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules and ensuring atomic operations. The structure achieves Authorization Independence via denormalization of the userId in the symptom_reports collection.\n\nTo support required QAPs:\n\n1.  Segregation of User Data: User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring that user-related data is isolated and accessible only to the user or authorized admins.\n2.  Symptom Reports with Path-Based Ownership: The `/users/{userId}/symptom_reports/{reportId}` structure enables secure list operations, ensuring that users can only access their own symptom reports. The `userId` is denormalized into the `symptom_reports` documents to guarantee authorization independence.\n3.  Admin Roles via Existence: Admin privileges can be checked by verifying the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection. This prevents filtering by content and adheres to QAPs."
