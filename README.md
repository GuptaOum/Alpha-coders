🚨 Project Presentation: AI-Powered Early Disease Outbreak Detection System

(Built using Firebase + Genkit)


---

1. Project Title

AI-Driven Early Disease Outbreak Prediction & Alert System


---

2. Introduction

Public health systems often react after an outbreak is already spreading. By the time authorities confirm cases of diseases like dengue, influenza, or new viral infections, valuable time is lost.
This time gap leads to:

Faster spread of the disease

Increased hospitalization

Delayed response and resource shortages

Higher risk to public safety


Our project solves this by creating a real-time, AI-powered early warning system.


---

3. Problem Statement

Public health agencies face a significant lag between the start of an outbreak and its official detection.
This happens because:

Traditional surveillance is slow

Testing and confirmation take time

Symptoms often go unreported

No centralized real-time monitoring


This delay allows the disease to spread undetected.


---

4. Proposed Solution

We propose an AI-based system that predicts potential outbreaks before they become critical.

✔ What the system does:

Collects real-time data from multiple sources

Uses AI (via Genkit) to detect unusual patterns

Predicts early outbreak risks

Sends instant alerts to users and health departments

Displays high-quality visual dashboards for trends



---
